              <h2>The Clojure Programming Language</h2>
              <p>Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic – every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.</p>
              <p>Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.</p>
              <p>I hope you find Clojure's combination of facilities elegant, powerful, practical and fun to use.</p>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Clojure has a set of useful features that together form a simple, coherent, and powerful tool.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <div class="clj-home-feature-item">
            <h4>Dynamic Development</h4>
            <p>Clojure is a dynamic environment you can interact with. Almost all of the language constructs are reified, and thus can be examined and changed. You can grow your program, with data loaded, adding features, fixing bugs, testing, in an unbroken stream.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <div class="clj-home-feature-item">
            <h4>Functional Programming</h4>
            <p>Clojure provides the tools to avoid mutable state, provides functions as first-class objects, and emphasizes recursive iteration instead of side-effect based looping. Clojure is impure, yet stands behind the philosophy that programs that are more functional are more robust.</p>

            <h4>LISP</h4>
            <p>Clojure is a member of the Lisp family of languages. Many of the features of Lisp have made it into other languages, but Lisp's approach to code-as-data and its macro system still set it apart. Additionally, Clojure’s maps, sets, and vectors are as first class in Clojure as lists are in Lisp.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <div class="clj-home-feature-item">
            <h4>Runtime Polymorphism</h4>
            <p>Systems that utilize runtime polymorphism are easier to change and extend. Clojure offers simple, powerful and flexible mechanisms for runtime polymorphism. Clojure’s protocols and datatypes features add mechanisms for abstraction and data structure definition with no compromises vs the facilities of the host platform.</p>

          <div class="clj-home-feature-item">
            <h4>Concurrent Programming</h4>
            <p>Clojure simplifies multi-threaded programming in several ways. Because the core data structures are immutable, they can be shared readily between threads. Clojure, being a practical language, allows state to change but provides mechanism to ensure that, when it does so, it remains consistent, while alleviating developers from having to avoid conflicts manually using locks etc.</p>

          <div class="clj-home-feature-item">
            <h4>Hosted on the JVM</h4>
            <p>Clojure is designed to be a hosted language, sharing the JVM type system, GC, threads etc. All functions are compiled to JVM bytecode. Clojure is a great Java library consumer, offering the dot-target-member notation for calls to Java. Clojure supports the dynamic implementation of Java interfaces and classes.</p>
